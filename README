void-mklive - The Void Linux live image maker

This is a simple shell script to build a live image for the Void
Linux distribution. The images contain a simple dialog-based installer
to be able to install Void linux to storage disks.

The generated image can be booted from BIOS and EFI systems (dual boot).
ISOLINUX is used to boot from PC-BIOS systems, while GRUB is used to
boot in EFI systems.

Dependencies:

 - xbps>=0.21
 - GNU bash
 - syslinux (to generate the PC-BIOS bootloader)
 - dosfstools (to generate the EFI bootloader)
 - xorriso (to generate the ISO image)
 - squashfs-tools (to generate the squashed rootfs)

Usage: void-mklive [options]

Options:
 -C file		Path to configuration file (defaults to ~/.mklive.conf)
 -c (gzip|bzip2|xz) 	Compression type for the squashfs/initramfs image.
 -l "pkgname ..."	Generate a local repository in the image with these packages.
 			Packages must be delimited by blanks.
 -r rootdir		Use this directory to generate the image (if unset,
 			current working directory will be used).
 -o outfile		Output file name for the ISO image.
 -s splash		Splash image file for isolinux.

* The first time it is executed a config file will be created (~/mklive.conf).

Take a look at the configuration file (~/mklive.conf) to tweak some
default parameters in the generated image.

Additionally void-mkrootfs generates a rootfs tarball suitable for unpacking
on a directory ready to 'chroot'; and `void-mkimage` can generate a working disk
image with a specified rootfs tarball.
